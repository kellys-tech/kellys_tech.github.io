## The challenges I met were:
1. The most difficult challenge I had was making the pages responsive to the various screen sizes
    a. this was solved by adding a viewport to each html file and using bootstraps grid sytem with rows and columns
2. Customizing the navbar to use colors other than the default
    a. this was done by using the navbar-custom class in the css and defining the background and text colors
3. Setting a background image to cover the entire background between the navbar and footer
    a. this was done in the css by linking the image and setting the properties such as position and size
