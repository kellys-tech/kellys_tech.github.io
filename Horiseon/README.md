# Horiseon Social Services Solution Homepage

*This is a homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services. This website is being created so any potential clients navigating to this site will see a snapshot on their homepage of the services the company can offer.*

## Webpage created using:
* HTML - to create the content of the homepage. 
* CSS -  to style the content.

## Features
* a header with a title and links to other parts of the page
* a hero image
* sections that contain an image and text
* a section to the side with text and an icon
* a footer

## The challenges I met were:
1. In the HTML, fixing the links in the header to navigate to a related section on the page when clicked
2. In the HTML, adding the semantic elements
3. In the CSS, combining styles and elements appropria tely to reduce cluttering the css with duplicate code

## The website is being hosted on github pages.
